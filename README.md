This is the GitHub pages branch for the tideline repository. If you'd like to have something added to the gallery here, issue a pull request against the main repository and specify that you're submitting something for the gallery.

(*For Tidepool developers.*) To update the current progress page from the branch you currently have checked out in the root-level tideline repository, run `./update-progress` from the embedded `web/` directory containing the `gh-pages` branch. (See instructions [here](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tideline/wiki/UpdatingTheGallery#setting-up-a-gh-pages-branch) to set up the `gh-pages` branch properly.) To check that the GitHub Pages' Jekyll server will serve everything correctly, use the `./jekyll` bash script (and view the results at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)) before pushing to the remote. To add something to the gallery from the branch you currently have checked out in the root-level tideline repository, follow the instructions in [the tideline wiki page dedicated to this topic](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tideline/wiki/UpdatingTheGallery#adding-a-page-to-the-gallery).
